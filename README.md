# Moon Bird

The goal of this project is to experiment and learn about Love 2D, a simplified game engine made in Lua, a programming language created in PUC-Rio, one of the most famous universities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

"Lua" means "moon" in portuguese, which is where the project name is inspired uppon. It is a data-drive language and was originally intended for embedded use in larger application and is popular in the video game industry.

First a [Pong game](https://github.com/mathmotta/moon-pong), and now, __Flappy Bird__!
